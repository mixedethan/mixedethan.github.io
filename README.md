## 📂 Featured Projects

### [NFL Run/Pass Prediction Engine ("Virtual Defensive Coordinator")](https://github.com/mixedethan/run-pass-predictions)
*Python, LightGBM, Streamlit*

A machine learning application designed to act as a Virtual Defensive Coordinator. It predicts whether an offense will Run or Pass, and whether they will "Go for it" on 4th Down based on game context.

* **Modeling:** Built a time-series validated "Cascade" LightGBM pipeline to predict offensive play-calling and 4th down decisions.
* **Performance:** Achieved **70% accuracy**, outperforming the positional baseline by 12%.
* **Deployment:** Deployed an interactive **Streamlit** web app allowing users to simulate "Defensive Coordinator" situations with live probability calibration.

[FourthDown.io Streamlit App](https://fourthdownio.streamlit.app)

### [Predicting CFB Wins 2025](https://github.com/mixedethan/predicting-cfb-wins-2025)
*Python, Scikit-Learn, Web Scraping (BeautifulSoup)*

A predictive modeling project forecasting College Football season outcomes using "Net Efficiency" metrics rather than simple win/loss records.

* **ETL Pipeline:** Built a robust automated pipeline using **BeautifulSoup** to scrape 9 years of team statistics from *cfbstats.com*, extracting 50+ raw metrics.
* **Analysis:** Engineered "Net Efficiency" features to train and tune Random Forest, Ridge, and Linear regression models that predict season Win %.
